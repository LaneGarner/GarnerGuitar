<h1>Minor pentatonic positions</h1>
<p>The minor pentatonic scale is one of the most-used scales in music and lays nicely on the guitar neck. You already
    know one position (or “box”) of the pentatonic scale. This fingering of the pentatonic scale is typically the first
    scale most guitarists learn. To play the pentatonic scale up and down the neck, we must first analyze the notes
    played. Once you feel comfortable with this key, try transposing the pentatonic scale positions to all twelve keys.
    We will begin with A-minor pentatonic. </p>


<p>Play the familiar pentatonic box at the fifth fret. Next, analyze the notes played in this fingering: A, C, D, E, and
    G. This sequence of notes repeats in each octave. These five notes are the source of this scale’s name with penta
    meaning five and tonic meaning tones or notes. The pentatonic scale is a five-note scale.</p>

<p>Next, analyze each scale degree using the A-major scale. The minor pentatonic scale is built with the root, b3, 4, 5,
    and b7 scale degrees. Memorizing these scale degrees will be helpful when improvising and soloing with the minor
    pentatonic scale.</p>


<h2>A minor pentatonic box one</h2>
<p>The pentatonic scale has five positions on the neck starting from each of the five notes of the scale. Learning these
    five positions will allow you to play the pentatonic scale up and down the neck without getting stuck in a box. Box
    one of the pentatonic scale starts with the root on the sixth string. The root is also located on the third and
    first strings. Being aware of the location of the root in each position will make it easier to transpose. </p>

<h2>A minor pentatonic box two</h2>
<p>Box two of the pentatonic scale starts with the flat third scale degree on the sixth string. The root is on the
    fourth and second strings. A-minor pentatonic box two starts at the eighth fret.</p>

<h2>A minor pentatonic box three</h2>
<p>Box three of the pentatonic scale starts with the fourth scale degree on the sixth string. The root is on the fifth
    and second strings. A-minor pentatonic box three starts at the tenth fret.</p>

<h2>A minor pentatonic box four</h2>
<p>Box four of the pentatonic scale starts with the fifth scale degree on the sixth string. The root is on the fifth and
    third strings. A-minor pentatonic box three starts at the twelfth fret. </p>

<h2>A minor pentatonic box five</h2>
<p>Box five of the pentatonic scale starts with the flat seven scale degree on the sixth string. The root is on the
    sixth, third, and first strings. A-minor pentatonic box three starts at the fifteenth or third fret.
