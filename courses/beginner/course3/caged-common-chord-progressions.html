<h1>Common chord progressions with CAGED shapes</h1>
<p>Now apply the CAGED-shapes to an I-vi-IV-V progression in the key of C. Remember, these four chords can be
    reorganized to give you the chords of many (if not most) songs. Once you feel comfortable with the notated
    progressions, change the order and/or the key. Refer to Lesson Seven for the common chord-progression song list.
    Remember, in the key of C: C is I, Am is vi, F is IV, and G is V. Practice these shapes as chords and as arpeggios.
