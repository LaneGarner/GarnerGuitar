<h1>Applying 'CAGED' to all 12 keys</h1>
<p>Now that you know all five shapes and some useful voicings from each shape, we can apply them to any key. The
    sequence of these shapes always goes in the order of C, A, G, E, D. For example, in C the sequence is C, A, G, E,
    and D. Start the pattern over for any of the other five keys. For example, in G the sequence is G, E, D, C, A.</p>

<h2>CAGED in C</h2>
<h3>C-A-G-E-D</h3>

<h2>CAGED in A</h2>
<h3>A-G-E-D-C</h3>

<h2>CAGED in G</h2>
<h3>G-E-D-C-A</h3>

<h2>CAGED in E</h2>
<h3>E-D-C-A-G</h3>

<h2>CAGED in D</h2>
<h3>D-C-A-G-E</h3>

<h2>CAGED in B</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as A<br>A-G-E-D-C</h3>

<h2>CAGED in F</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as E<br>E-D-C-A-G</h3>

<h2>CAGED in F#/Gb</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as E<br>E-D-C-A-G</h3>

<h2>CAGED in G#/Ab</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as G<br>G-E-D-C-A</h3>

<h2>CAGED in A#/Bb</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as A<br>A-G-E-D-C</h3>

<h2>CAGED in C#/Db</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as C<br>C-A-G-E-D</h3>

<h2>CAGED in D#/Eb</h2>
<h3>Same sequence as C<br>C-A-G-E-D</h3>
