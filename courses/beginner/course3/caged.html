<h1>The CAGED system</h1>
<p>The CAGED system is a useful way to learn more advanced chords even if your understanding of music theory is not
    quite there yet. If you already know theory, then CAGED is a great way to view the instrument from an alternative
    perspective. Use CAGED to find chords, arpeggios, and scales in all keys and positions on the guitar neck. Along
    with a basic
    knowledge of the notes on the neck, CAGED will guide your playing up the neck and to new levels.</p>

<p>CAGED is an acronym for some of the most common chord shapes on guitar: C, A, G, E, and D. Each of these shapes can
    be played as barre chord by moving the shape up and fretting the previously open strings. Playing these barre chords
    may require alternate fingerings, and some have extra notes which can be added to the basic shape.</p>

<h2>C shape</h2>
<p>To play the C shape as a barre chord, first re-finger the chord with your fourth, third, and second fingers.</p>

<p>Next, move all fingers up one fret and barre the third and first-strings first-fret with your first finger. The root
    note is notated in red throughout this lesson. Determine the root by the position where a chord shape is played on
    the neck. </p>

<p>The full version of the C shape uses all four fingers and a barre and it can be kind of difficult to play. Try
    playing smaller parts of the chord to find some more useful voicings like these:</p>

<h3>Useful voicings</h3>

<h2>A shape</h2>
<p>You will recognize the A shape from Part One. This shape can be fingered with a third finger barre or
    alternatively with fingers two, three, and four. </p>

<h3>Useful voicings</h3>

<h2>G shape</h2>
<p>The G shape is particularly tricky to play as a barre chord.
    Playing parts of the full shape is considerably more useful than the full shape.</p>
<h3>Useful voicings</h3>

<h2>E shape</h2>
<p>You will also recognize the E shape from Part One. This shape has many useful voicings. </p>
<h3>Useful voicings</h3>

<h2>D shape</h2>
<p>Many beginners will struggle to play the full version of the D shape. Donâ€™t let this discourage you. There are some
    useful voicings that you can derive from this shape.</p>
