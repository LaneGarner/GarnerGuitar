<h1>Major pentatonic</h1>
<p>So far we have focused on the minor pentatonic and minor blues scales. These same positions and shapes can also be
    used to play major pentatonic and major blues scales. In a major key, use the relative minor pentatonic scale to
    find the major pentatonic scale. (Shortcut: relative major and minor are a minor third, or four frets, apart).
    Analyzing the notes of the pentatonic scale from the major root (C, D, E, G, A) gives you the root, second, third,
    fifth, and sixth scale degrees. The names of each position are the same as the minor pentatonic positions with box
    one starting with the root of the minor pentatonic on the sixth string.</p>
