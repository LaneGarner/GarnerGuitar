<h1>Tab & standard notation together</h1>
<p>Occasionally it may be helpful to notate music in tab and standard notation at the same time. This is especially
    useful to show where to play a note that can be played in many places on the neck. The next few examples use two
    staves (tab and standard notation) which consist of the exact same written music. Pay attention to the bracket on
    the left to know which system to move your eyes to next.</p>
