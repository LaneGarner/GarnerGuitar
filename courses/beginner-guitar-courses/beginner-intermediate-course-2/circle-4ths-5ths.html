<h1>Circle of Fourths/Fifths & Key Signatures</h1>
<p>Now that you have played single-string major scales for each key, it is time to memorize each key signature. The
    circle of fourths/fifths contains all twelve chromatic notes. Following the circle counter-clockwise will give the
    interval of a perfect fourth between notes, while clockwise will give a perfect fifth.</p>

<h2>Sharp Keys</h2>
<p>Follow the circle clockwise in fifths. You will first come to the key of G. The key of G has one sharp and it is the
    note F#. F# is the seventh scale degree in the key of G. Each note along the circle of fifths adds one sharp each
    time. This added sharp is always the seventh scale degree of each new key (RED).
    For example, in the key of D, keep the F# and add C# (the seventh scale degree in D). Next comes the key of A. Keep
    the F# and C# and add G# (the seventh scale degree in A). Continue in the same way all around the circle of fifths.
</p>

<h2>Flat Keys</h2>
<p>Follow the circle counterclockwise in fourths. This side works similarly to the sharp side, but rather than raising
    the seventh scale degree, we will lower the fourth scale degree (GREEN). Tip: the fourth scale degree also happens
    to be the next key in the circle of fourths.
    For example: the key of F has one flat, B-flat, which is the fourth scale degree in F (or the next key on the
    circle). For the key of B-flat, keep B-flat, and add the fourth degree (or next key) of E-flat. Continue similarly
    around the circle of fourths.

<p>*G-flat and F-sharp are enharmonically the same.</p>

<p>** Sudden urge to ride roller coasters.</p>

<p>Note: Since the key of C has no sharps and no flats, the keys of C sharp and C flat have seven sharps and seven flats
    respectively.</p>

<h2>Key signatures on the staff</h2>
<p>The key signature is placed between the clef and time signature at the beginning of a piece of music. Sharps or flats
    are placed on the lines and spaces of the staff to tell you which notes are raised or lowered in a given key. When a
    key signature indicates raising or lowering a pitch, that pitch remains altered throughout the entire piece.</p>
