<h1>Finger Combinations</h1>
<p> The matrix on the following page contains all possible combinations of the numbers 1-4. It is a study in the
    one-finger-per-fret rule. Each number represents a left-hand finger. Start off with the first finger at the fifth
    fret. In the fifth position, the frets are not too far apart or too close together. Later, practice this exercise
    starting at the first fret then walk up to each fret/position and back down. These exercises prepare you for
    position playing.</p>
<p>This finger exercise should be practiced in many ways: all combinations on one string, one combination on all
    strings, as an arpeggio with each combination on a set of four strings, as an arpeggio with string skips, and so on.
    Practice using different subdivisions with a metronome and pay close attention to coordinating the left and right
    hands. If you want to get crazy, apply these combinations to the spider exercise. Within the spider, you will not
    always be able to leave each finger down. When you must lift a finger to play a lower-sounding note, lift as
    minimally as possible while remaining in the ready position.</p>
