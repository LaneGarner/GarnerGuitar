<h1>Pull-offs & hammer-ons</h1>
<h2>Pull-offs</h2>
<p> A pull-off is used when moving from a higher note to a lower note. Hammer-ons and pull-offs allow you to play
    smoothly connected legato notes and are useful for fast passages. Use the left-hand finger to pluck the string. A
    pull-off is usually indicated by a tied note and a P (or sometimes PO). </p>

<h2>Hammer-ons</h2>
<p> A hammer-on is used when moving from a lower note to a higher note. It is called a hammer-on for a reason. Imagine
    hammering a nail into a wall. It is not enough to simply whack the hammer and hope for the best. With this method
    you would end up with many holes in the wall. Like a hammer, it is important to precisely aim the tip of the finger
    at the fret and drive it in (i.e. keep pressure down). A good hammer-on will also have a bit of a wind-up in the
    left-hand finger just like you might do with a hammer.</p>

<h2>Fretted pull-offs & hammer-ons</h2>
<p> The previous examples utilized open string hammer onâ€™s and pull offs. These techniques are also possible between
    fretted notes. The following examples are similar to the finger combination warm up with only with two fingers. </p>
