<h1>Spider exercises</h1>
<p> Spider exercises are named for the appearance of the fingers crawling across the fretboard. Most of these exercises
    sound a bit dissonant and spooky but are great tools for building technique. Many beginners have trouble keeping
    their left-hand fingers in a ready position. These exercises help get your fingers accustomed to the feel of a good
    position.</p>

<h2>Spider exercise one</h2>
<p> One-finger-per-fret with the first finger at the fifth fret. Once you play a note, leave the finger down on the
    string until it is needed again--even when changing strings. Like always, start off slowly and intentionally. </p>

<h2>Spider exercise two</h2>
<p> One-finger-per-fret at the fifth fret. See and feel the fingers walking across the strings. Keep each finger down
    after a note is played.</p>
