<h1>Finger planting</h1>
<p>Finger planting is how farmers grow hands. <em>Just kidding.</em> Like the spider, these exercises train your fingers to be ready. For each exercise, plant three fingers on the third string using the one-finger-per-fret rule. Move the remaining finger between the fifth, second, sixth, and first strings. </p>
