<h1>Building Major Scales</h1>
<p>You might recognize the major scale from the song “Do-Re-Mi” from The Sound of Music. Most Western music is based on
    the major scale. We will first learn all twelve major scales on single strings starting with the E major scale. Play
    on the first or six string at these frets:</p>

<p>Going up in pitch is called ascending. Also play the scale descending, or going down.</p>

<p>An interval is the distance between two notes. The first two intervals to learn are the half step and the whole step.
    On
    the guitar, a half step is one fret and a whole step is two frets. Analyzing the notes of the E major scale will
    reveal
    a pattern of half-steps and whole-steps.</p>

<p>This pattern of whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half is used to play all major scales. Once you get the hang
    of
    the E major scale, try major scales from the remaining open strings.</p>

<p>Next, play the C major scale. Start with C at the second-string, first-fret and apply the interval pattern:</p>

<p>A major scale always contains all seven letters of the musical alphabet (A-G). These letters go in order and start on
    the same letter name as the major scale name. For example, C major scale starts with the note C.</p>

<p>What notes are in the C major scale you just played?</p>

<ul>
    <li>1st fret- C</li>
    <li>3rd fret- D</li>
    <li>5th fret-E</li>
    <li>6th fret-F</li>
    <li>8th fret-G</li>
    <li>10th fret-A</li>
    <li>12th fret-B</li>
    <li>13th fret-C</li>
</ul>

<p>A key signature indicates which notes are sharp or flat in a particular key. The key of C major has only natural
    notes—no sharps or flats.</p>

<p>Start from any note and use W-W-H-W-W-W-H and all seven letters of the musical alphabet to find each key signature.
