<h1>Scales</h1>
<p> Practice scales on their own or along with another technique. As you learn more theory, apply these same methods to
    new scales. Don’t worry about the theory for now; just focus on playing the scale. Try to recognize the notes by
    saying the note name out loud. Don’t just think it. Say it out loud! Scales are also a great way to practice
    technique in a slightly more musical context.</p>

<h2>Chromatic scale: open position</h2>
<p>The chromatic scale contains all twelve notes of the octave. Start by playing it in the open position and eventually
    progress to other positions up the neck.</p>
