<h1>Upstroke exercise</h1>
<p> Upstrokes tend to be weaker than downstrokes for many players. Not only is the motion slightly awkward, but it
    requires a literal fight against gravity. Therefore, practicing with upstrokes only is a useful challenge. This
    example applies upstrokes to open strings in quarter notes, though the concept can (and should) be played in any
    rhythmic or melodic context. </p>
