<h2>Flats and repeats</h2>

<p>The next example uses two new devices: the flat accidental and the repeat sign. The flat sign resembles a lowercase
    b and is placed before a note on the staff. To flat a note, drop the note by one half-step (one fret). In this case
    we will play B-flat at the third-string third-fret (one fret lower than the B tuning note at the fourth-string
    fourth-fret).</p>
<p>A repeat sign is a double bar line with two dots on either the left or the right. If the dots are on the right, it
    is a forward-facing repeat, and if they are on the left, it is a backward-facing repeat. Repeat signs sometimes have
    brackets which, for our purposes, make it clearer which section is to be repeated. To play a repeat, simply repeat
    the music between the two repeat signs.

<h2>Deck the Halls</h2>

<h2>Sharps & pickup measures</h2>
<p> A sharp looks like a number sign or hashtag. Think of a sharp as the opposite of a flat. To play a sharp, raise the
    note one half-step (one fret). In this example, play F# at the fourth-string fourth-fret (one fret higher than F). A
    pickup measure is an incomplete measure that comes at the beginning of a song. It may be helpful to count backwards
    to find which beat to start on. “The Dreidel Song” begins on the and-of-four and “O Christmas Tree” begins on beat
    three.</p>
