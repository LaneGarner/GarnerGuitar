<h1>The rhythmic heirarchy exercise</h1>
<p>Play a measure of each subdivision from long to short and back.</p>

<h2>Triplets</h2>
<p> Another common subdivision is the triplet. A triplet fits three beats in the space of two. It is indicated by the
    number 3 within a bracket over three notes. To feel a triplet, think of the next largest subdivision and break it
    into three beats. For instance, feel a quarter-note triplet by placing three beats in the space of a half note.
    Likewise, feel an eighth-note triplet by placing three beats in the space of a quarter note. While there are
    smaller/larger triplet subdivisions, these are the most common, so focus on them first. </p>

<p> Practice triplets by themselves and within the rhythmic hierarchy exercise. Once you have mastered the following,
    try adding in half-note triplets (three beats in the space of a whole note) or sixteenth-note triplets (three beats
    in the space of an eighth note).</p>
