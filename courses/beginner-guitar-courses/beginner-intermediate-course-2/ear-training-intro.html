<h1>Introduction to ear training</h1>
<p>Ear training is one of the best ways to develop your musicianship. Simply listening to music is an excellent way to
    train your ears. One way to begin training your ears is to practice interval recognition. Like with any skill, start
    slowly and patiently progress to more advanced ear-training skills such as harmonic intervals, chords, chord
    progressions, and note recognition.</p>
<p>A common way to recognize intervals is to compare them to the first few notes of a familiar song. Aim to eventually
    recognize intervals without these songs. This is a starting point. Choose a song that you know for each interval in
    the
    list.</p>
<p>When learning to hear both ascending and descending intervals, start slow. Choose a few common intervals (M2, M3, P4,
    P5, Octave) to start, then add new intervals one at a time. Progress may come slowly at first, but stick with it and
    practice ear training daily. You will be surprised how quickly your ears grow. Listen for intervals in daily life:
    songs
    you hear, door bells, ring tones, etc.</p>
