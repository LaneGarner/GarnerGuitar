<h1>Dominant seventh chords</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve learned to play a 12 blues with shuffle patterns, lets try it with seventh chords. To build a seventh
    chord start with a major triad (if you need a refresher on building triads revisit part two).</p>

<h2>First, lets look at the key of A:</h2>


<p>A major triad contains the root, third, and fifth scale degree; a dominant seventh chord adds the flat seven scale
    degree. To find the flatted seven, lower the seventh scale degree by a half step. In the key of A, the seventh scale
    degree is G#, so the flat seven is G. The notes in an A7 chord are as follows:</p>

<p>Now let’s play an A7 chord on the guitar. Begin with the familiar open A chord and add the flat seven (G). Which
    notes of the A chord could easily be traded for a G? This note is located in two convenient places: the open third
    string or the first string third fret.
