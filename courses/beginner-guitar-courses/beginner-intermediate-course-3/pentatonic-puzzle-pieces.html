<h1>Pentatonic puzzle pieces</h1>
<p>Connecting pentatonic positions allows you to play up and down the neck. The top notes of each pentatonic position
    are the same as the bottom notes of the next pentatonic position. Use these “puzzle-piece” shapes to connect
    pentatonic positions together visually. The marked frets are for the key of A minor, but this concept can be used in
    any key.</p>
