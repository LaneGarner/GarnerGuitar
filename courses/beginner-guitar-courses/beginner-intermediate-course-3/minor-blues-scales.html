<h1>Minor blues scales</h1>
<p>The minor blues scale is nearly identical to the minor pentatonic scale with one additional note called the blue
    note. Add this note to same pentatonic “box” you have already learned in two places: the second finger on the
    fifth-string sixth-fret and the third finger (one fret out of position) on the third-string eighth-fret. Practice
    ascending and descending, then try mixing up the notes to solo on an A blues. </p>

<h2>Triplets</h2>
<p>The strings with blue notes are notated with a bracketed 3 above them. This rhythm is called a triplet. In this case
    it is an eighth-note triplet. Three eighth-note triplets fit into the same space as two eighth notes (one beat). You
    could also have sixteenth-note triplets, quarter-note triplets, half-note triplets, etc. Eighth-note triplets give
    music a gentle “swinging” feel and are commonly used in blues and jazz.</p>

<h2>E minor blues scale</h2>
<p>This scale is played in both the twelfth and open positions. Practice ascending and descending, then try mixing up
    the notes to solo on an A blues. </p>
