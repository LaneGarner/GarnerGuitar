<h1>Pentatonic shifting</h1>
<p>Another way to practice connecting pentatonic positions is to shift positions on each string.
</p>

<h2>Box one to two</h2>


<h2>Box two to three</h2>


<h2>Box three to four</h2>


<h2>Box four to five</h2>


<h2>Box five to one</h2>


<h2>Shifting on every string</h2>
<p>This final shifting exercise is a bit more difficult than the previous ones but looks really impressive since it
    covers such a large range of the instrument- from a low G on the 6th string to a high C on the 1st string. This
    covers all five pentatonic boxes- starting with box five, then box one, two, three, four, five, and finally one
    again.</p>
