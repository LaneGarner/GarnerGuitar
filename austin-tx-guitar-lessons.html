                <strong>Hi, I'm Lane Garner.</strong>&nbsp; I’ve been teaching guitar lessons for over ten years and have experience with students of all ages and experience levels. I have Masters and Bachelors degrees in Jazz Studies from the University of North Texas. As a performer I have traveled all over the country and world playing various styles ranging from jazz, rock, and pop to classical, country, worship music, and more. I am currently filling my lesson studio here in Austin.</p>
                <p>I offer private guitar lessons to students in Austin, TX wishing to learn guitar or develop their guitar and music skills beyond a beginner level. We will take your playing to the next level by studying music theory, technique, jazz and blues improvisation, gear and tone, reading music, playing styles, and more.</p>
                <p>Whether you just started playing guitar or you’ve played for years there is always something new to learn about music. My primary goal as a teacher is to focus intently on specific aspects of each student's musicianship- technique, harmonic concepts, ear-training, theory, etc while making each lesson fun for the student. It is my goal to improve the student’s playing by the end of each and every lesson. I find it important to teach fundamentals of music as well as any additional material the student is interested in learning. In my 10+ years of teaching guitar I’ve worked with students of all levels and ages 5 to 65. I’ve taught total beginners, intermediate players, college music majors, and even working musicians.</p>
